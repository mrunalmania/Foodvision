Implement Transformer architecture in computer vision task (Object Detection) and compare the ViT (Vision Transformer) feature extractor and EffnetB2 models, achieving prediction accuracy of more than 95% and prediction time of less than 30FPS (Real-time). Also, host the whole model on hugging face spaces and put it into production.
